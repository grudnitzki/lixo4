Exclusive Digital Playground contract star Jesse Jane finds herself infatuated with a budding online relationship, but as the requests become kinkier and stranger, she begins to worry if she really knows the man on the other side of the keyboard. "Jesse Jane: Online" from director Robby D. is a dark, sexual exploration into the world of Internet dating, where people are never who they seem. Jesse's cyber beau Scott asks her to do everything from pleasuring one of his friends to picking up fetish items--though worried, Jesse will do anything to satisfy him. "Jesse Jane: Online" also stars babes Shawna Lenee and Madelyn Marie in a movie so hot and erotic, only Digital Playground could produce it.<BR><BR>
